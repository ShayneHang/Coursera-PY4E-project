objective:
    - retrieve the most recommended and least recommended food, it does not mean the 
    most mentioned food is the most delicious, it must be most mentioned plus with 
    positives reviews
    
    
    # more for business owner usage
    - find out which period of the year has the most reviews, and if there's any
    seasonal trend to it
    
    - make a stats of returning customer (e.g. look for duplicate usernames in the
    review and check if their ratings has increase or decrease over time)
    
    - to identify the reviews on the food, service, cleaniness, and place in general
    
    - what are the evolution of recommended/not recommended food throughout the years
